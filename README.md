# Magic Text

Magic Text was a part of Rails week 3 at Epicodus. This project was for learning how to setup an API using rails and Twillio. The point of the application is to create a contact list and have the ability to send customer texts from the website using Twilio. 

## Usage

To run this project you must have rails installed.

Open project in terminal and run bundle to install necessary gems and run the following in terminal.

```
rake db:create
rake db:seed
rake db:migrate
rails s
```

You should then be able to open on localhost:3000. From there you can register a new account and add contacts to send messages for. As of now you would need a twilio account of your own to use as the registered number to send from.
